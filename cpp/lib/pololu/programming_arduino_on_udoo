Strange behaviors when programming arduino on UDOO - follow this procedure to properly program:

1. DO NOT program using the inbuilt LUbuntu Arduino IDE
2. Connect external pc via mini-USB to UDOO via USB CN6
3. open minicom on external pc with settings /dev/ttyUSB0 115200 8N1 no hardware/software flow control - then the following in quick succession when wanting to upload new sketch:
4. listen on serial port while rebooting/booting UDOO with jumper on J18
5. interrupt boot sequence when prompted
6. CLOSE minicom to free serial port
7. move jumper from J18 to J22 (the one directly next to J18) for ~1 second
8. move jumper from J22 to J16 (the one directly below J22) for ~1 second
9. remove jumper from J16
10. upload sketch from external computer using Arduino IDE nightly, with /dev/ttyUSB0 and Arduino Due (Programming Port) - REMEMBER! You may need to chmod 777 /dev/ttyUSB0 to allow writing out of the serial port to arduino
11. when finished uploading place jumper back on J18
12. press reset button on UDOO to boot back into onboard LUbuntu
13. DONE!
